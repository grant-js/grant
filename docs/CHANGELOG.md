## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- f8d52ec: Add Google as a platform and project OAuth sign-in provider, with account linking, verified contact-email bind, and IdP profile picture inheritance.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 31399fc: Add organization logos that owners can upload and that replace initials in lists, the edit dialog, and the organization switcher.

  The logo is stored as `pictureUrl`, written only through `uploadOrganizationPicture` / `POST /api/organizations/:id/picture` (MIME and size checks, public storage). `Organization:UploadPicture` is granted to Organization Owner. Existing deployments need `db:seed` so the new permission is inserted.

### Minor Changes

- c515e3e: Add a domain-event backbone with project webhooks and in-app notifications.

  Services publish catalogued events into a transactional outbox that drives signed webhook delivery and preference-aware notifications. The release covers IAM CRUD and assignment events, API key rotate (`api_key.rotated`), CDM import event suppression with `project_sync.completed` / `project_sync.failed` summaries, and dashboard UI for subscriptions, deliveries, and the notification center.

## 1.4.2

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 4fcca1d: Separate shareable organization invitation links from email-delivered verification proof so copied invitation links cannot auto-verify an email address.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fd61e91: Add CDM email identity imports for project sync jobs.

  CDM users with `findBy: email` now resolve through the global email authentication catalog, creating an unverified passwordless email authentication method when needed. Project OAuth email magic-link proof verifies imported email methods, and the docs/schema now describe the global identity semantics.
