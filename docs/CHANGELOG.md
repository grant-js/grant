## 1.5.1

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c515e3e: Add a domain-event backbone with project webhooks and in-app notifications.

  Services publish catalogued events into a transactional outbox that drives signed webhook delivery and preference-aware notifications. The release covers IAM CRUD and assignment events, API key rotate (`api_key.rotated`), CDM import event suppression with `project_sync.completed` / `project_sync.failed` summaries, and dashboard UI for subscriptions, deliveries, and the notification center.

## 1.4.2

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 4fcca1d: Separate shareable organization invitation links from email-delivered verification proof so copied invitation links cannot auto-verify an email address.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fd61e91: Add CDM email identity imports for project sync jobs.

  CDM users with `findBy: email` now resolve through the global email authentication catalog, creating an unverified passwordless email authentication method when needed. Project OAuth email magic-link proof verifies imported email methods, and the docs/schema now describe the global identity semantics.
