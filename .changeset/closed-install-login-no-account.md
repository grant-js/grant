On a closed install (`AUTH_PUBLIC_SIGNUP_ENABLED=false`), login no longer creates a Personal account for an identity that has none. Registration was already gated, but the first platform login of an identity that exists without an account (a CDM-imported user, a user who only signed in to a Project App) created one, which gave console access: "Forgot password?" works for any email identity, so a password reset followed by a login was enough. Login now follows the register policy for every method (email and password, GitHub, Google) and, when it refuses, still issues the session, account-less. A valid organization invitation proof, the first human on an empty install, or an organization membership (an administrator added the user to an organization) still creates the account, exactly as before; an install with public sign-up on is unchanged.

An account-less session reaches only user-scoped operations (profile, security, preferences, notifications, privacy including data export and deletion, project memberships); every account-scoped query, mutation and route is refused by the permission check. `createMySecondaryAccount` (GraphQL and `POST /api/me/accounts`) now follows the register policy for a user who owns no account, and users who already have an account can still add the complementary one. Linking a GitHub or Google sign-in to an existing identity that has no account no longer fails with "User does not have an account": it follows the same rule.

`MeResponse` gains `hasOrganizationMembership` (GraphQL `me`, REST `GET /api/me`), which the console uses to tell a user with no workspace from an organization member who has no account.

Console: after login an account-less user lands on Settings -> Project memberships, which explains that there is no workspace on this installation. The settings hub, the account settings page and every account-scoped dashboard page redirect there, the Account entry is hidden from the settings sidebar and the account menu, and the privacy page words the deletion as deleting the identity.
