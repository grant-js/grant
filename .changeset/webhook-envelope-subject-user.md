Webhook deliveries now say **which user an event is about**. The CloudEvents envelope has a new extension attribute, `grantsubjectuser: { "userId": "…" }` (or `null` when the event has no subject user), next to `grantactor`. Revoke and remove events such as `user.role_revoked`, `user.group_revoked`, `user.permission_revoked` and `project.user_removed` used to arrive with an empty `data` (the internal `before` snapshot is not delivered) and a `subject` that is the id of the assignment record, so a consumer could not tell whose access changed; it can now read the user id from `grantsubjectuser`. `data` and redaction are unchanged, and the new attribute is additive.
