## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 8c9af41: Skip storage directory chown in the API Docker entrypoint when the container is not running as root, so Kubernetes deployments with `readOnlyRootFilesystem` and `securityContext.runAsUser` can start successfully.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 01e0ed1: Fix GraphQL codegen duplicate schema types by splitting `schema-types` and operation outputs. Compile the API for production Docker images (replace `tsx` runtime), align REST routes and web hooks with generated types, and fix demo storage volume permissions via entrypoint.
